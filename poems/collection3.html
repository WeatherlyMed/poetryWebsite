            <h2>Poem 1: Unnamed</h2>
            <p>Happiness is found in community.
            Success is found in community.
            Everything is comparative but it is also collectively made.
             From the one who wrote a textbook to the one who kept you sane
            Self made is a lie.
            Everyone else made you.
            You made them.
            So celebrate together.
            Cry together.
            One for all and all for one.</p>
