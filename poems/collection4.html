            <h2>Poem 1: Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening by Robery Frost</h2>
            <p>Whose woods these are I think I know.   
                His house is in the village though;   
                He will not see me stopping here   
                To watch his woods fill up with snow.   
                
                My little horse must think it queer   
                To stop without a farmhouse near   
                Between the woods and frozen lake   
                The darkest evening of the year.   
                
                He gives his harness bells a shake   
                To ask if there is some mistake.   
                The only other sound’s the sweep   
                Of easy wind and downy flake.   
                
                The woods are lovely, dark and deep,   
                But I have promises to keep,   
                And miles to go before I sleep,   
                And miles to go before I sleep.</p>

            <h2>Poem 2: The Orange by Wendy Cope</h2>
            <p>At lunchtime I bought a huge orange—
                The size of it made us all laugh.
                I peeled it and shared it with Robert and Dave—
                They got quarters and I had a half.
                
                And that orange, it made me so happy,
                As ordinary things often do
                Just lately. The shopping. A walk in the park.
                This is peace and contentment. It’s new.
                
                The rest of the day was quite easy.
                I did all the jobs on my list
                And enjoyed them and had some time over.
                I love you. I’m glad I exist.</p>
